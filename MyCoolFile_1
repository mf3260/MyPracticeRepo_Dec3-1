There are many great movie sequels:
  Terminator 2
  Godfather 2
  Empire Strikes back

The other great sequels:
  Police academy 2
  The matrix reloaded (pretty good)

The third movies in trilogies is not always as good!

And fourth movies if they occur can be awful!!

What about the Marvel avengers series?
