There are many great movie sequels
Terminator 2
Godfather 2
Empire Strikes back

There other great sequels
Police academy 2

The matrix reloaded was pretty good.

The third movies in trilogies is not always as good!

And fourth movies if they occur can be awful!!

What about the Marvel avengers series?
